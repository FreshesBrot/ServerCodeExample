Example Code of a backend server I developed for a university project.

Each folder contains a specific part of the Project:

* **controllers** <p>
Contains the main execution .java file that delegates all requests to the server to the functions that handle the specific request.
</p>

* **db** <p>
Contains the interfaces and implementations to the MongoDB API.
</p>

* **Exceptions** <p>
Contains all Exceptions that can be thrown at runtime.
</p>

* **interfaces** <p>
Contains interfaces some objects needed to implement in order to be handled properly during runtime.
</p>

* **models** <p>
Contains all objects that manage data during runtime.
</p>
